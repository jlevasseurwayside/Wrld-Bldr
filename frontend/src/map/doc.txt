1. Generate random array of points on a grid
2. Create a "frame" of addition points (2 triangles) that represent the farthest reach of the grid.
3. Create "regions" based on the grid by itterating over grid points (exlcuding the frame).
    3a. Creates triangles based on grid.
    3b. Creates regions based on a central point (found by itterating over all points)
    3c. All triangles that share the region central point are considered part of the region.
    3d. This means all regions share triangles.
4. From these regions, create "patches"
    4a. Patches are created from the center points of all triangles for a region.
